### Please Note 
* I had created the EmployeeSQL folder in my original repository, while puching the files into my git, it kept giving errors and my branch was not working as it kept showing as FATAL. Therefore I had to creater my repositories 7 times and, finally for the last time i created a repository and I dragged all the folders and copied here, there after this worked. Sorry but for some reason my EmployeeSQL folder is not showing up here. How ever i have done all the necessary work needed.
